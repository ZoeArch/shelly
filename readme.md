# Shelly - Cursed shell identifier
the goal of this project is to create a utility capable of identifying and posssibly creating cursed tank shells.

## Step 1
- get list of shell parts
- parse input text
- write output

Example:

APBCFSHESHDS -> AP BC FS HE SH DS

|Shorthand  | Full name         |
|---        |---                |
|AP         |Armor Piercing     |
|BC         |Balistic Capped    |
|FS         |Fin Stabilised     |
|HE         |High explosive     |
|SH         |Squash Head        |
|DS         |Discarding Sabot   |

Armor Piercing Balisitc Capped Fin satbilised High Explosive Squash Head Discarding Sabot Shell

## step 2 (future)
- write gui
- add shell builder

## step 3 (very much optional)
- reddit bot
